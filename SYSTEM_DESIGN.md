### System Architecture:

Both the Student Management System and Age Calculator projects are standalone desktop applications. They utilize the PyQt6 library for building graphical user interfaces and handling user interactions. The applications interact with an SQLite database for storing and retrieving data.

#### Components:

1. **User Interface (UI):** This component is responsible for rendering the graphical user interface and receiving user input. It includes various input fields, buttons, tables, and dialogs.

2. **Database Interaction:** Manages interactions with the SQLite database to store and retrieve student records for the Student Management System.

3. **Business Logic:** Contains the application's logic for data manipulation, calculations, and operations. It connects the UI and database components.

4. **Dialog Windows:** These are specialized UI elements for specific tasks, such as adding, editing, searching, and deleting student records.

### Data Flow:

1. **User Input:** Users interact with the UI by providing inputs like student information (name, course, mobile) in the Student Management System or a name and birth date in the Age Calculator.

2. **UI Rendering:** The UI renders input fields, buttons, tables, and dialogs based on user interactions.

3. **Business Logic:** Depending on the user's action, the business logic performs operations such as adding, editing, searching, or calculating age.

4. **Database Interaction:** For the Student Management System, the application interacts with the SQLite database to store and retrieve student records. For the Age Calculator, the database interaction is not relevant.

5. **UI Updates:** The UI is updated to reflect changes made to student records or to display the calculated age.

### Technology Stack:

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **GUI Library:** PyQt6
- **Database:** SQLite

### Deployment:

- The applications can be distributed as standalone executables on various desktop platforms.

### Scalability:

- Both projects are relatively small in scope. However, for future enhancements, you could consider adding features such as advanced search filters, data visualization, and data export options to the Student Management System.

### Security Considerations:

- Since both applications interact with databases, ensure that database connections are established securely and sensitive data is handled with care.

### Error Handling:

- Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle cases where the user provides invalid inputs or database operations fail.

### Performance:

- Given the lightweight nature of these applications, performance considerations are minimal. However, as the projects grow, optimizing database queries and UI rendering could become more important.

This high-level system design provides a foundation for building and enhancing the Student Management System and Age Calculator projects. Depending on the specific requirements and complexity, you can tailor and expand the design as needed.
